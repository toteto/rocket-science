Welcome to XOCeption!
Here are some basic rules to get you started.
---------------------------------
Game mechanics: 
  - The game contains one main X-O board, but each cell has been replaced by another standard (mini) X-O board. 
  - The game starts with all mini boards available to be played. Next mini board to be played is decided by the cell that is played in the previous move.
       Ex. If player X player in top-left cell, player O "has" to play in top-left mini board.
  - If the mini board is already WON, then the player gets to choose from all available mini boards.
How to win:
  - To win the mini X-O board, you need 3 of the same in one row, column or diagonal. Standard stuff.
  - To win the game, you need to win 3 mini boards in one row, column or diagonal. Twisted stuff.

Some words about the game:
I got this game idea the immediate second Tomche Delev said we could make X-O game as project for the course Visual Programing, but try to make it our self not just copy it from the internet.
Additional game mechanics were improved by searching for similar game. Similar game concept can be found on http://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2013/06/16/ultimate-tic-tac-toe/
